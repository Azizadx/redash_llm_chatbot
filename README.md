## Project Design
The Redash chat add-on is structured around four essential components, each residing in its dedicated folder within the system:
- [Redash Package](https://github.com/Azizadx/redash_llm_chatbot/tree/main/packages/Redash): Develop the user-facing interface of the Redash add-on.
- [Backend Package](https://github.com/Azizadx/redash_llm_chatbot/tree/main/packages/backend): Houses the intelligent engine powering the add-on.
- [Data Warehousing Package](https://github.com/Azizadx/redash_llm_chatbot/tree/main/packages/data_warehousing): Manages and organizes the data infrastructure.
- [ML Package](https://github.com/Azizadx/redash_llm_chatbot/tree/main/packages/ml): Uses machine learning methods to provide more sophisticated analysis capabilities.
